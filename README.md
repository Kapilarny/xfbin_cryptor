# XFBIN Cryptor

A simple tool to decrypt XFBIN files.

## Usage

1. Create a `key.txt` file (in the same directory as the `xfbin_decryptor.exe`), which contains the 16-character key used to decrypt the XFBIN file.
    Example:
    ```
    A1B2C3D4E5F6A7B8
    ```
2. Drag & drop the XFBIN file (or a directory containing XFBIN files) onto the `xfbin_cryptor.exe`.
3. Profit!
